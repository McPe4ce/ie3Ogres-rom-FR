# Handoff — current state

Quick orientation for the next session. Full detail is in
[`docs/FORMAT_NOTES.md`](docs/FORMAT_NOTES.md) (source of truth) and the four
skills in `.claude/skills/`. Read [`README.md`](README.md) first.

## Where we are (2026-07-18)

Both former blockers are **solved** and the `.pkb` translation pipeline is
**built and byte-exact verified**:

| Thing | State |
|---|---|
| `.STR` indexing (offset vs index) | ✅ **ordinal index** — resizing safe (no offset table exists anywhere). |
| Custom French encoding | ✅ **solved** — 11 lowercase accents + `0x81` symbols, in `tools/ie3_codec.py`. |
| `.pkb`/`.pkh` slot model | ✅ **byte-exact round-trip** on all 2972 evet + 28 mcht slots. |
| `.pkb` extract → edit → reinsert | ✅ **built & tested** (`evet_dump.py` / `evet_reinsert.py`). |
| Translating the text | ⬜ **not started** — Phil (the owner) will draft French. |
| `.STR` dump/reinsert tools | ⬜ not built (mechanism understood). |
| Whole-ROM repack + emulator test | ⬜ not started (no emulator installed). |

## The pipeline (use these; don't rewrite)

Run from `tools/` with the venv active (`source venv/bin/activate`):

```bash
python3 evet_dump.py evet --jp-only -o evet_jp.json   # extract 15,756 untranslated JP chunks
#  ... edit the "fr" field of each entry in evet_jp.json ...
python3 evet_reinsert.py evet_jp.json --out evet_new.pkb   # writes a NEW .pkb, original untouched
```

- `ie3_codec.py` — the French text codec (`decode_text` / `encode_text`). Run
  it directly for a round-trip self-test. **Import it; never re-derive the table.**
- `evet_slots.py` — byte-exact slot model (`load_slots`, `Slot`). Run directly
  to re-prove round-trip (0 failures expected).
- `evet_dump.py` / `evet_reinsert.py` — extract / reinsert. A no-op reinsert
  reproduces the original `.pkb` byte-for-byte (that's the correctness check).
- `evet_extract.py` — lower-level slot→chunk parser + classifier (imported by
  the above; also runnable for inspection).

One-shot probes kept for provenance (not routine use): `analyze_str_dat*.py`,
`find_offset_table.py`, `verify_str_align.py`, `derive_encoding*.py`.

## Must-know gotchas before touching the code

- **A slot owns exactly `budget` bytes** at its `.pkh` offset. The gap to the
  next record is `04 FF FF…` inter-slot filler — NOT part of the slot.
- **Every sub-string's first byte is a control code** (box/speaker style,
  always a multiple of 4). `evet_dump` strips it into the `lead` field and
  `evet_reinsert` re-attaches it automatically — the editable `fr` text should
  NOT include it.
- **Translations must fit the slot budget.** French is often longer than the
  compact Japanese; `evet_reinsert` refuses to write and lists overflowing
  slots so you can shorten them. Slack comes from the slot's zero-padding.
- **Encoding is lowercase-accents only.** This translation uses no uppercase
  accented letters; `encode_text` folds uppercase accents / `ë ö ü œ æ` / `« »`
  to ASCII house-style and reports each fold. If real uppercase-accent bytes
  are ever needed, parse `data_iz/font/FONT12.NFTR`'s CMAP (not yet done).

## Recommended next steps (roughly in order)

1. **Whole-ROM repack via `ndspy`** — write an edited `.pkb`/`.STR` back into a
   fresh `.nds` so there's something testable. (No repack tool exists yet.)
2. **Set up an emulator** (melonDS/DeSmuME) and validate on a *small* test
   patch: confirm accents render and control codes aren't garbled, and that
   in-slot sub-string reflow displays correctly. Nothing has been visually
   verified yet — only byte-verified.
3. **`.STR` dump/reinsert tools** — mirror the evet workflow for
   `item.STR` / `unitbase.STR` (ordinal index; preserve string count, order,
   null terminators, and 32-byte alignment — the four invariants).

## Ground rules

- The `.nds` ROM is a personal copy — **never commit it** (`.gitignore` covers
  `*.nds`). `extracted/` and `tools/venv/` are gitignored too; regenerate.
- Keep `docs/FORMAT_NOTES.md` as the source of truth; the skills point to it.
